## Features

- Change the speed
	- You can change `FPS` manually in the code, which will change the speed. The higher the `FPS` the faster the game.
	- You can also change the game speed inside the game by pressing `+` and `-` buttons, to increase and decrease the speed.

- Change the size
  	- Tweaking `WN` and `HN` will change the number of pixels for width and height respectively.
  	- Also changing `BLOCK_SIZE` will determine the size of each pixel in the game.

- Change the pixel shape
  	- You can set `SHAPE = 'circle'` to change the pixel shape. Default is `SHAPE = 'square'`.

	- When `SHAPE = 'square'`, you can change `ROUNDNESS` to change the roundness of the snake's head.
   		By default `ROUNDNESS` is equal to `BLOCK_SIZE` which will make the head round.
   		You can set `ROUNDNESS` to `0` to make the head square-shaped.

  		Here is how it looks for `ROUNDNESS = 0`:

- Change number of foods
  
	You can change `NUM_FOODS` to set the number of foods of the game. The default is of course `1`.

	Here is how it looks for `NUM_FOODS = 3`:
